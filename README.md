# Week-7-Assignment
Week 7 Assignment Final Project Ideas

For my final assignment, I will create a page that features information on my music blog called Blend & Snap. 
It will essentially be a rough draft of the website that features music from SounCloud, interview with a photo, an about section
with information on the project, and a way to get in touch with us via email. It will feature my logo (hopefully, 
as long as I can figure it out haha) of the site, plus I wll feature each photo and description for every mix Blend & Snap has made. I plan on also setting up a playlist on spotify and connecting that to my page via API somehow. 
It will work almost as a brief rough sketch of what my future website will be one day.
